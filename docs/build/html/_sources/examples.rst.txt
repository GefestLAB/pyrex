Working with Signal Objects
===========================

The base ``Signal`` class is simply an array of times and an array of signal values, and is instantiated with these two arrays. The ``times`` array is assumed to be in units of seconds, but there are no general units for the ``values`` array. It is worth noting that the Signal object stores shallow copies of the passed arrays, so changing the original arrays will not affect the ``Signal`` object. ::

    time_array = np.linspace(0, 10)
    value_array = np.sin(time_array)
    my_signal = pyrex.Signal(times=time_array, values=value_array)

Plotting the ``Signal`` object is as simple as plotting the times vs the values::

    plt.plot(my_signal.times, my_signal.values)
    plt.show()

While there are no specified units for a ``Signal.values``, there is the option to specify the ``value_type`` of the ``values``. This is done using the ``Signal.ValueTypes`` enum. By default, a ``Signal`` object has ``value_type=ValueTypes.unknown``. However, if the signal represents a voltage, electric field, or electric power; ``value_type`` can be set to ``Signal.ValueTypes.voltage``, ``Signal.ValueTypes.field``, or ``Signal.ValueTypes.power`` respectively::

    my_voltage_signal = pyrex.Signal(times=time_array, values=value_array,
                                     value_type=pyrex.Signal.ValueTypes.voltage)

``Signal`` objects can be added as long as they have the same time array and ``value_type``. ``Signal`` objects also support the python ``sum`` function::

    time_array = np.linspace(0, 10)
    values1 = np.sin(time_array)
    values2 = np.cos(time_array)
    signal1 = pyrex.Signal(time_array, values1)
    plt.plot(signal1.times, signal1.values, label="signal1 = sin(t)")
    signal2 = pyrex.Signal(time_array, values2)
    plt.plot(signal2.times, signal2.values, label="signal2 = cos(t)")
    signal3 = signal1 + signal2
    plt.plot(signal3.times, signal3.values, label="signal3 = sin(t)+cos(t)")
    all_signals = [signal1, signal2, signal3]
    signal4 = sum(all_signals)
    plt.plot(signal4.times, signal4.values, label="signal4 = 2*(sin(t)+cos(t))")
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

The ``Signal`` class provides many convenience attributes for dealing with signals::

    my_signal.dt == my_signal.times[1] - my_signal.times[0]
    my_signal.spectrum == scipy.fftpack.fft(my_signal.values)
    my_signal.frequencies == scipy.fftpack.fftfreq(n=len(my_signal.values),
                                                   d=my_signal.dt)
    my_signal.envelope == np.abs(scipy.signal.hilbert(my_signal.values))

The ``Signal`` class also provides functions for manipulating the signal. The ``resample`` function will resample the times and values arrays to the given number of points (with the same endpoints)::

    my_signal.resample(1001)
    len(my_signal.times) == len(my_signal.values) == 1001
    my_signal.times[0] == 0
    my_signal.times[-1] == 10
    plt.plot(my_signal.times, my_signal.values)
    plt.show()

The ``with_times`` function will interpolate/extrapolate the signal's values onto a new times array::

    new_times = np.linspace(-5, 15)
    new_signal = my_signal.with_times(new_times)
    plt.plot(new_signal.times, new_signal.values, label="new signal")
    plt.plot(my_signal.times, my_signal.values, label="original signal")
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

The ``filter_frequencies`` function will apply a frequency-domain filter to the values array based on the passed frequency response function::

    def lowpass_filter(frequency):
        if frequency < 1:
            return 1
        else:
            return 0

    time_array = np.linspace(0, 10, 1001)
    value_array = np.sin(0.1*2*np.pi*time_array) + np.sin(2*2*np.pi*time_array)
    my_signal = pyrex.Signal(times=time_array, values=value_array)

    plt.plot(my_signal.times, my_signal.values)
    my_signal.filter_frequencies(lowpass_filter)
    plt.plot(my_signal.times, my_signal.values)
    plt.show()


A number of classes which inherit from the Signal class are included in PyREx: ``EmptySignal``, ``FunctionSignal``, ``AskaryanSignal``, and ``ThermalNoise``. ``EmptySignal`` is simply a signal whose values are all zero::

    time_array = np.linspace(0,10)
    empty = pyrex.EmptySignal(times=time_array)
    plt.plot(empty.times, empty.values)
    plt.show()

``FunctionSignal`` takes a function of time and creates a signal based on that function::

    time_array = np.linspace(0, 10, num=101)
    def square_wave(time):
        if int(time)%2==0:
            return 1
        else:
            return -1
    square_signal = pyrex.FunctionSignal(times=time_array, function=square_wave)
    plt.plot(square_signal.times, square_signal.values)
    plt.show()

Additionally, ``FunctionSignal`` leverages its knowledge of the function to more accurately interpolate and extrapolate values for the ``with_times`` function::

    new_times = np.linspace(0, 20, num=201)
    long_square_signal = square_signal.with_times(new_times)
    plt.plot(long_square_signal.times, long_square_signal.values, label="new signal")
    plt.plot(square_signal.times, square_signal.values, label="original signal")
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

``AskaryanSignal`` produces an Askaryan pulse (in V/m) on a time array due to a neutrino of given energy observed at a given angle from the shower axis::

    time_array = np.linspace(-10e-9, 40e-9, 1001)
    neutrino_energy = 1e8 # GeV
    observation_angle = 45 * np.pi/180 # radians
    askaryan = pyrex.AskaryanSignal(times=time_array, energy=neutrino_energy,
                                    theta=observation_angle)
    print(askaryan.value_type)
    plt.plot(askaryan.times, askaryan.values)
    plt.show()

``ThermalNoise`` produces Rayleigh noise (in V) at a given temperature and resistance which has been passed through a bandpass filter of the given frequency range::

    time_array = np.linspace(-10e-9, 40e-9, 1001)
    noise_temp = 300 # K
    system_resistance = 1000 # ohm
    frequency_range = (550e6, 750e6) # Hz
    noise = pyrex.ThermalNoise(times=time_array, temperature=noise_temp,
                               resistance=system_resistance,
                               f_band=frequency_range)
    print(noise.value_type)
    plt.plot(noise.times, noise.values)
    plt.show()

Note that since ``ThermalNoise`` inherits from ``FunctionSignal``, it can be extrapolated nicely to new times. It may be highly periodic outside of its original time range however, unless a large number of frequencies is requested on initialization. ::

    short_noise = pyrex.ThermalNoise(times=time_array, temperature=noise_temp,
                                     resistance=system_resistance,
                                     f_band=(100e6, 400e6))
    long_noise = short_noise.with_times(np.linspace(-10e-9, 90e-9, 2001))

    plt.plot(short_noise.times, short_noise.values)
    plt.show()
    plt.plot(long_noise.times, long_noise.values)
    plt.show()



Antenna Class and Subclasses
============================

The base ``Antenna`` class provided by PyREx is designed to be inherited from to match the needs of each project. At its core, an ``Antenna`` object is initialized with a position, a temperature, and a frequency range, as well as optionally a resistance for noise calculations and a boolean dictating whether or not noise should be added to the antenna's signals (note that if noise is to be added, a resistance must be specified). ::

    # Please note that some values are unrealistic in order to simplify demonstration
    position = (0, 0, -100) # m
    temperature = 300 # K
    resistance = 1e17 # ohm
    frequency_range = (0, 5) # Hz
    basic_antenna = pyrex.Antenna(position=position, temperature=temperature,
                                  resistance=resistance,
                                  freq_range=frequency_range)
    noiseless_antenna = pyrex.Antenna(position=position, noisy=False)

The basic properties of an ``Antenna`` object are ``is_hit`` and ``waveforms``. ``is_hit`` specifies whether or not the antenna has been triggered by an event. ``waveforms`` is a list of all the waveforms which have triggered the antenna. The antenna also defines ``signals``, which is a list of all signals the antenna has received, and ``all_waveforms`` which is a list of all waveforms (signal plus noise) the antenna has received including those which didn't trigger. ::

    basic_antenna.is_hit == False
    basic_antenna.waveforms == []

The ``Antenna`` class contains two attributes and three methods which represent characteristics of the antenna as they relate to signal processing. The attributes are ``efficiency`` and ``antenna_factor``, and the methods are ``response``, ``directional_gain``, and ``polarization_gain``. The attributes are to be set and the methods overwritten in order to custmoize the way the antenna responds to incoming signals. ``efficiency`` is simply a scalar which multiplies the signal the antenna receives (default value is ``1``). ``antenna_factor`` is a factor used in converting received electric fields into voltages (``antenna_factor`` = E / V; default value is ``1``). ``response`` takes a frequency or list of frequencies (in Hz) and returns the frequency response of the antenna at each frequency given (default always returns ``1``). ``directional_gain`` takes angles theta and phi in the antenna's coordinates and returns the antenna's gain for a signal coming from that direction (default always returns ``1``). ``directional_gain`` is dependent on the antenna's orientation, which is defined by its ``z_axis`` and ``x_axis`` attributes. To change the antenna's orientation, use the ``set_orientation`` method which takes ``z_axis`` and ``x_axis`` arguments. Finally, ``polarization_gain`` takes a polarization vector and returns the antenna's gain for a signal with that polarization (default always returns ``1``). ::

    basic_antenna.efficiency == 1
    basic_antenna.antenna_factor == 1
    freqs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    basic_antenna.response(freqs) == [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    basic_antenna.directional_gain(theta=np.pi/2, phi=0) == 1
    basic_antenna.polarization_gain([0,0,1]) == 1

The ``Antenna`` class defines a ``trigger`` method which is also expected to be overwritten. ``trigger`` takes a ``Signal`` object as an argument and returns a boolean of whether or not the antenna would trigger on that signal (default always returns ``True``). ::

    basic_antenna.trigger(pyrex.Signal([0],[0])) == True

The ``Antenna`` class also defines a ``receive`` method which takes a ``Signal`` object and processes the signal according to the antenna's attributes (``efficiency``, ``antenna_factor``, ``response``, ``directional_gain``, and ``polarization_gain`` as described above). To use the ``receive`` function, simply pass it the ``Signal`` object the antenna sees, and the ``Antenna`` class will handle the rest. You can also optionally specify the origin point of the signal (used in ``directional_gain`` calculation) and the polarization direction of the signal (used in ``polarization_gain`` calculation). If either of these is unspecified, the corresponding gain will simply be set to ``1``. ::

    incoming_signal_1 = pyrex.FunctionSignal(np.linspace(0,2*np.pi), np.sin,
                                             value_type=pyrex.Signal.ValueTypes.voltage)
    incoming_signal_2 = pyrex.FunctionSignal(np.linspace(4*np.pi,6*np.pi), np.sin,
                                             value_type=pyrex.Signal.ValueTypes.voltage)
    basic_antenna.receive(incoming_signal_1)
    basic_antenna.receive(incoming_signal_2, origin=[0,0,-300], polarization=[1,0,0])
    basic_antenna.is_hit == True
    for waveform, pure_signal in zip(basic_antenna.waveforms, basic_antenna.signals):
        plt.figure()
        plt.plot(waveform.times, waveform.values, label="Waveform")
        plt.plot(pure_signal.times, pure_signal.values, label="Pure Signal")
        plt.legend()
        plt.show()

Beyond ``Antenna.waveforms``, the ``Antenna`` object also provides methods for checking the waveform and trigger status for arbitrary times: ``full_waveform`` and ``is_hit_during``. Both of these methods take a time array as an argument and return the waveform ``Signal`` object for those times and whether said waveform triggered the antenna, respectively. ::

    total_waveform = basic_antenna.full_waveform(np.linspace(0,20))
    plt.plot(total_waveform.times, total_waveform.values, label="Total Waveform")
    plt.plot(incoming_signal_1.times, incoming_signal_1.values, label="Pure Signals")
    plt.plot(incoming_signal_2.times, incoming_signal_2.values, color="C1")
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

    basic_antenna.is_hit_during(np.linspace(0, 200e-9)) == True

Finally, the ``Antenna`` class defines a ``clear`` method which will reset the antenna to a state of having received no signals::

    basic_antenna.clear()
    basic_antenna.is_hit == False
    len(basic_antenna.waveforms) == 0


To create a custom antenna, simply inherit from the ``Antenna`` class::

    class NoiselessThresholdAntenna(pyrex.Antenna):
        def __init__(self, position, threshold):
            super().__init__(position=position, noisy=False)
            self.threshold = threshold

        def trigger(self, signal):
            if max(np.abs(signal.values)) > self.threshold:
                return True
            else:
                return False

Our custom ``NoiselessThresholdAntenna`` should only trigger when the amplitude of a signal exceeds its threshold value::

    my_antenna = NoiselessThresholdAntenna(position=(0, 0, 0), threshold=2)

    incoming_signal = pyrex.FunctionSignal(np.linspace(0,10), np.sin,
                                           value_type=pyrex.Signal.ValueTypes.voltage)
    my_antenna.receive(incoming_signal)
    my_antenna.is_hit == False
    len(my_antenna.waveforms) == 0
    len(my_antenna.all_waveforms) == 1

    incoming_signal = pyrex.Signal(incoming_signal.times,
                                   5*incoming_signal.values,
                                   incoming_signal.value_type)
    my_antenna.receive(incoming_signal)
    my_antenna.is_hit == True
    len(my_antenna.waveforms) == 1
    len(my_antenna.all_waveforms) == 2

    for wave in my_antenna.waveforms:
        plt.figure()
        plt.plot(wave.times, wave.values)
        plt.show()

For more on customizing PyREx, see the `custom-package` section.


PyREx defines ``DipoleAntenna`` which as a subclass of ``Antenna``, which provides a basic threshold trigger, a basic bandpass filter frequency response, a sine-function directional gain, and a typical dot-product polarization effect. A ``DipoleAntenna`` object is created as follows::

    antenna_identifier = "antenna 1"
    position = (0, 0, -100)
    center_frequency = 250e6 # Hz
    bandwidth = 300e6 # Hz
    resistance = 100 # ohm
    antenna_length = 3e8/center_frequency/2 # m
    polarization_direction = (0, 0, 1)
    trigger_threshold = 1e-5 # V
    dipole = pyrex.DipoleAntenna(name=antenna_identifier,position=position,
                                 center_frequency=center_frequency,
                                 bandwidth=bandwidth, resistance=resistance,
                                 effective_height=antenna_length,
                                 orientation=polarization_direction,
                                 trigger_threshold=trigger_threshold)



AntennaSystem and Detector Classes
==================================

The ``AntennaSystem`` class is designed to bridge the gap between the basic antenna classes and realistic antenna systems including front-end processing of the antenna's signals. It is designed to be subclassed, but by default it takes as an argument the ``Antenna`` class or subclass it is extending, or an object of that class. It provides an interface nearly identical to that of the ``Antenna`` class, but where a ``front_end`` method (which by default does nothing) is applied to the extended antenna's signals.

To extend an ``Antenna`` class or subclass into a full antenna system, subclass the ``AntennaSystem`` class and define the ``front_end`` method. Optionally a trigger can be defined for the antenna system (by default it uses the antenna's trigger)::

    class PowerAntennaSystem(pyrex.AntennaSystem):
        """Antenna system whose signals and waveforms are powers instead of
        voltages."""
        def __init__(self, position, temperature, resistance, frequency_range):
            super().__init__(pyrex.Antenna)
            # The setup_antenna method simply passes all arguments on to the
            # antenna class passed to super.__init__() and stores the resulting
            # antenna to self.antenna
            self.setup_antenna(position=position, temperature=temperature,
                               resistance=resistance,
                               freq_range=frequency_range)

        def front_end(self, signal):
            return pyrex.Signal(signal.times, signal.values**2,
                                value_type=pyrex.Signal.ValueTypes.power)

Objects of this class can then, for the most part, be interacted with as though they were regular antenna objects::

    position = (0, 0, -100) # m
    temperature = 300 # K
    resistance = 1e17 # ohm
    frequency_range = (0, 5) # Hz

    basic_antenna_system = PowerAntennaSystem(position=position,
                                              temperature=temperature,
                                              resistance=resistance,
                                              frequency_range=frequency_range)

    basic_antenna_system.trigger(pyrex.Signal([0],[0])) == True

    incoming_signal_1 = pyrex.FunctionSignal(np.linspace(0,2*np.pi), np.sin,
                                             value_type=pyrex.Signal.ValueTypes.voltage)
    incoming_signal_2 = pyrex.FunctionSignal(np.linspace(4*np.pi,6*np.pi), np.sin,
                                             value_type=pyrex.Signal.ValueTypes.voltage)
    basic_antenna_system.receive(incoming_signal_1)
    basic_antenna_system.receive(incoming_signal_2, origin=[0,0,-300],
                                 polarization=[1,0,0])
    basic_antenna_system.is_hit == True
    for waveform, pure_signal in zip(basic_antenna_system.waveforms,
                                     basic_antenna_system.signals):
        plt.figure()
        plt.plot(waveform.times, waveform.values, label="Waveform")
        plt.plot(pure_signal.times, pure_signal.values, label="Pure Signal")
        plt.legend()
        plt.show()

    total_waveform = basic_antenna_system.full_waveform(np.linspace(0,20))
    plt.plot(total_waveform.times, total_waveform.values, label="Total Waveform")
    plt.plot(incoming_signal_1.times, incoming_signal_1.values, label="Pure Signals")
    plt.plot(incoming_signal_2.times, incoming_signal_2.values, color="C1")
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

    basic_antenna_system.is_hit_during(np.linspace(0, 200e-9)) == True

    basic_antenna_system.clear()
    basic_antenna_system.is_hit == False
    len(basic_antenna_system.waveforms) == 0


The ``Detector`` class is another convenience class meant to be subclassed. It is useful for automatically generating many antennas (as would be used to build a detector). Subclasses must define a ``set_positions`` method to assign vector positions to the self.antenna_positions attribute. By default ``set_positions`` will raise a ``NotImplementedError``. Additionally subclasses may extend the default ``build_antennas`` method which by default simply builds antennas of a passed antenna class using any keyword arguments passed to the method. In addition to simply generating many antennas at desired positions, another convenience of the ``Detector`` class is that once the ``build_antennas`` method is run, it can be iterated directly as though the object were a list of the antennas it generated. An example of subclassing the ``Detector`` class is shown below::

    class AntennaGrid(pyrex.Detector):
        """A detector composed of a plane of antennas in a rectangular grid layout
        some distance below the ice."""
        def set_positions(self, number, separation=10, depth=-50):
            self.antenna_positions = []
            n_x = int(np.sqrt(number))
            n_y = int(number/n_x)
            dx = separation
            dy = separation
            for i in range(n_x):
                x = -dx*n_x/2 + dx/2 + dx*i
                for j in range(n_y):
                    y = -dy*n_y/2 + dy/2 + dy*j
                    self.antenna_positions.append((x, y, depth))

    grid_detector = AntennaGrid(9)

    # Build the antennas
    temperature = 300 # K
    resistance = 1e17 # ohm
    frequency_range = (0, 5) # Hz
    grid_detector.build_antennas(pyrex.Antenna, temperature=temperature,
                                 resistance=resistance,
                                 freq_range=frequency_range)

    plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))
    for antenna in grid_detector:
        x = antenna.position[0]
        y = antenna.position[1]
        plt.plot(x, y, "kD")
    plt.ylim(plt.xlim())
    plt.show()

Due to the parallels between ``Antenna`` and ``AntennaSystem``, an antenna system may also be used in the custom detector class. Note however, that the antenna positions must be accessed as ``antenna.antenna.position`` since we didn't define a position attribute for the ``PowerAntennaSystem``::

    grid_detector = AntennaGrid(12)

    # Build the antennas
    temperature = 300 # K
    resistance = 1e17 # ohm
    frequency_range = (0, 5) # Hz
    grid_detector.build_antennas(PowerAntennaSystem, temperature=temperature,
                                resistance=resistance,
                                frequency_range=frequency_range)

    for antenna in grid_detector:
        x = antenna.antenna.position[0]
        y = antenna.antenna.position[1]
        plt.plot(x, y, "kD")
    plt.show()



Ice and Earth Models
====================

PyREx provides a class ``IceModel``, which is an alias for whichever south pole ice model class is the preferred (currently just the basic ``AntarcticIce``). The ``IceModel`` class provides class methods for calculating characteristics of the ice at different depths and frequencies outlined below::

    depth = -1000 # m
    pyrex.IceModel.temperature(depth)
    pyrex.IceModel.index(depth)
    pyrex.IceModel.gradient(depth)
    frequency = 1e8 # Hz
    pyrex.IceModel.attenuation_length(depth, frequency)

PyREx also provides two functions realted to its earth model: ``prem_density`` and ``slant_depth``. ``prem_density`` calculates the density in grams per cubic centimeter of the earth at a given radius::

    radius = 6360000 # m
    pyrex.prem_density(radius)

``slant_depth`` calculates the material thickness in grams per square centimeter of a chord cutting through the earth at a given nadir angle, starting from a given depth::

    nadir_angle = 60 * np.pi/180 # radians
    depth = 1000 # m
    pyrex.slant_depth(nadir_angle, depth)



Particle Generation
===================

PyREx includes ``Particle`` as a container for information about neutrinos which are generated to produce Askaryan pulses. ``Particle`` contains three attributes: ``vertex``, ``direction``, and ``energy``::

    initial_position = (0,0,0) # m
    direction_vector = (0,0,-1)
    particle_energy = 1e8 # GeV
    pyrex.Particle(vertex=initial_position, direction=direction_vector,
                   energy=particle_energy)

PyREx also includes a ``ShadowGenerator`` class for generating random neutrinos, taking into account some Earth shadowing. The neutrinos are generated in a box of given size, and with an energy given by an energy generation function::

    box_width = 1000 # m
    box_depth = 500 # m
    const_energy_generator = lambda: 1e8 # GeV
    my_generator = pyrex.ShadowGenerator(dx=box_width, dy=box_width,
                                         dz=box_depth,
                                         energy_generator=const_energy_generator)
    my_generator.create_particle()

Lastly, PyREx includes ``ListGenerator`` and ``FileGenerator`` classes which can be used to reproduce pre-generated particles from either a list or from numpy files, respectively.



Ray Tracing
===========

PyREx provides ray tracing in the ``RayTracer`` and ``RayTracerPath`` classes. ``RayTracer`` takes a launch point and receiving point as arguments (and optionally an ice model and z-step), and will solve for the paths between the points (as ``RayTracerPath`` objects). ::

    start = (0, 0, -250) # m
    finish = (100, 0, -100) # m
    my_ray_tracer = pyrex.RayTracer(from_point=start, to_point=finish)

The two most useful properties of ``RayTracer`` are ``RayTracer.exists`` and ``RayTracer.solutions``. ``RayTracer.exists`` is a boolean value of whether or not path solutions exist between the launch and receiving points. ``RayTracer.solutions`` is the list of (zero or two) ``RayTracerPath`` objects which exist between the launch and receiving points. There are many other properties available in ``RayTracer``, outlined in the `pyrex-api` section, which are mostly used internally and maybe not interesting otherwise. ::

    my_ray_tracer.exists
    my_ray_tracer.solutions

The ``RayTracerPath`` class contains the attributes of the paths between points. The most useful properties of ``RayTracerPath`` are ``RayTracerPath.tof``, ``RayTracerPath.path_length``, ``RayTracerPath.emitted_direction``, and ``RayTracerPath.received_direction``. These properties provide the time of flight, path length, and direction of rays at the launch and receiving points respectively. ::

    my_path = my_ray_tracer.solutions[0]
    my_path.tof
    my_path.path_length
    my_path.emitted_direction
    my_path.received_direction

``RayTracePath`` also provides the ``RayTracePath.attenuation()`` method which gives the attenuation of the signal at a given frequency (or frequencies), and the ``RayTracePath.coordinates`` property which gives the x, y, and z coordinates of the path (useful mostly for plotting, and are not garuanteed to be accurate for other purposes). ::

    frequency = 500e6 # Hz
    my_path.attenuation(100e6)
    my_path.attenuation(np.linspace(1e8, 1e9, 11))
    plt.plot(my_path.coordinates[0], my_path.coordinates[2])
    plt.show()

Finally, ``RayTracePath.propagate()`` propagates a ``Signal`` object from the launch point to the receiving point by applying the frequency-dependent attenuation of ``RayTracePath.attenuation()``, and shifting the signal times by ``RayTracePath.tof``. Note that it does not apply a 1/R effect based on the path length. If needed, this effect should be added in manually. ::

    time_array = np.linspace(0, 5e-9, 1001)
    my_signal = (pyrex.FunctionSignal(time_array, lambda t: np.sin(1e9*2*np.pi*t))
                + pyrex.FunctionSignal(time_array, lambda t: np.sin(1e10*2*np.pi*t)))
    plt.plot(my_signal.times, my_signal.values)
    plt.show()

    my_path.propagate(my_signal)
    my_signal.values /= my_path.path_length
    plt.plot(my_signal.times, my_signal.values)
    plt.show()



Full Simulation
===============

PyREx provides the ``EventKernel`` class to control a basic simulation including the creation of neutrinos, the propagation of their pulses to the antennas, and the triggering of the antennas::

    particle_generator = pyrex.ShadowGenerator(dx=1000, dy=1000, dz=500,
                                               energy_generator=lambda: 1e8)
    detector = []
    for i, z in enumerate([-100, -150, -200, -250]):
        detector.append(
            pyrex.DipoleAntenna(name="antenna_"+str(i), position=(0, 0, z),
                                center_frequency=250e6, bandwidth=300e6,
                                resistance=0, effective_height=0.6,
                                trigger_threshold=0, noisy=False)
        )
    kernel = pyrex.EventKernel(generator=particle_generator,
                               ice_model=pyrex.IceModel,
                               antennas=detector)

    triggered = False
    while not triggered:
        kernel.event()
        for antenna in detector:
            if antenna.is_hit:
                triggered = True
                break
    
    for antenna in detector:
        for i, wave in enumerate(antenna.waveforms):
            plt.plot(wave.times * 1e9, wave.values)
            plt.xlabel("Time (ns)")
            plt.ylabel("Voltage (V)")
            plt.title(antenna.name + " - waveform "+str(i))
