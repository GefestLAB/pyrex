# PyREx ARA Custom Module

This python module is designed to extend the custom sub-package of PyREx (https://github.com/bhokansonfasig/pyrex) to contain ARA-specific classes and functions.

To integrate this module with PyREx, clone this directory into either your ~/.pyrex-custom/ directory or into the pyrex-custom directory in your working directory. This will allow PyREx to find the module and will allow access using import pyrex.custom.ara
